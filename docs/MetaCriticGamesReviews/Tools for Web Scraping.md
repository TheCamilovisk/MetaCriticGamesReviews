Before selecting tools, it's essential to understand the project's specific needs, such as the complexity of the websites to be scraped (dynamic content, JavaScript-heavy sites, etc.), rate limiting concerns, and the need for data parsing and storage capabilities.

# Target Website
Our target website will be the [games section of Metacritic.com](https://www.metacritic.com/game/). It's a mix of static and dynamic content.

## Website Complexity
The content that's interesting for us can be found in three types of section:
- Games list: this content is mostly static, and extracting it won't be a problem.
- Game Info: we'll extract the information data for each games previously collected from their specific page, as most of the content is also static.
- Game users reviews: things become complex here, as these pages load review data dynamically from an API endpoint.

## Rate Limits and Bot Access
We'll be nice and respect the robots.txt of the site. It's pretty simple though. Here's the full file content:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /search
Disallow: /signup
Disallow: /login
Disallow: /user
Disallow: /jl/
# Google is crawling the Ad defineSlot() parameters.  Exclude them so we don't get a bunch of 404s.
Disallow: /8264/
Disallow: /7336/

Sitemap: https://www.metacritic.com/galleries/index.xml
Sitemap: https://www.metacritic.com/games.xml
Sitemap: https://www.metacritic.com/movies.xml
Sitemap: https://www.metacritic.com/tvshows.xml
Sitemap: https://www.metacritic.com/celebrities.xml
```
As we can see, pretty much the entire site is accessible by any bot user-agent, except for a few ones that, fortunately, are not interesting for us.

There aren't rate limits definitions, but we still must be careful and apply basic rate limiting and user-agent rotation strategies.

## Data Parsing
The games list and information data is scattered throughout the site in specific HTML tags, requiring HTML parsers to extract them efficiently.
The games reviews are supplied to the site by an API endpoint. So our initial strategy will be to mimic the site's call to this endpoint. The complexity of this task is unknown yet, but we must at least take measurements to avoid being banned.

## Data Storage
Initially, must of the data pipeline will run locally, but we want to leave room to improvements, like sending the data to a cloud storage service.
Also, we won't do an extensive extraction. So storage size won't be a problem.

# Tools and Frameworks
This table highlights the primary use, ease of use, support for dynamic content, community support, and features related to ethical scraping for each tool. While tools like Scrapy offer built-in support for ethical scraping practices, most others require manual compliance with such practices.

# Chosen tools
Requests and Beautiful Soup are highly compatible with each other. Requests is used to make HTTP requests to web pages, effectively fetching the HTML content of any website. Beautiful Soup, on the other hand, is a powerful HTML and XML parsing library. It allows for easy navigation, searching, and modification of the parse tree. Once Requests has fetched the webpage, Beautiful Soup can parse the content and extract the necessary data. This seamless integration between fetching and parsing operations makes the combination of Requests and Beautiful Soup a go-to choice for many developers.
## Pros
1. **Ease of Use**: Both libraries have a gentle learning curve, making them accessible to beginners and efficient for experienced developers.
2. **Flexibility**: This combination allows for scraping both simple and moderately complex websites by handling various HTML/XML structures.
3. **Community Support**: With extensive documentation and a large community, finding solutions to common problems is easier, accelerating development.
4. **Efficiency in Parsing**: Beautiful Soup provides several methods to navigate the parse tree, which can significantly speed up the scraping process when combined with the efficient HTTP requests made by Requests.
## Cons:
1. **Dynamic Content Handling**: The major limitation of using Requests and Beautiful Soup is their inability to scrape dynamic content loaded by JavaScript. This can be a significant drawback when dealing with modern web applications that rely heavily on JavaScript for rendering content.
2. **Speed**: While suitable for many projects, this combination may not be as fast as other frameworks like Scrapy, especially for large-scale web scraping tasks, due to the lack of built-in concurrency features.
3. **Manual Handling of Scraping Ethics**: There's a need for manual implementation of ethical scraping practices, such as respecting robots.txt files and managing request rates, which can add complexity to the project.
Given the project's scope and requirements, the combination of Requests and Beautiful Soup is highly effective, offering a straightforward and efficient approach to web scraping. The primary limitation to consider is the potential impact on performance with very large-scale tasks, but for many projects, especially those dealing with static content and adhering to ethical guidelines, this combination is both practical and powerful.
